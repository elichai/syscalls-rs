`linux-sys` provides the correct headers to access linux user-api directly. <br>
All the types in this crate are autogenerated at compile time and will have different types per platform.
The fact that you see `type Foo = u8` doesn't mean you can just use `u8`, you have to use `Foo` as on some platforms it might be `i8` or `u32`. <br>

Please open issues if there's any typedef/struct missing that you'd like (currently contains only the major headers for technical reasons https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Synchronizing_Headers)

*Note* this aren't necessarily libc compatible, and if you need to work with lib please see the [libc crate](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc). <br>

## Usage
The versions in this crate match the Linux Kernel version that was used to generate the headers.

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
linux-sys = "5.4"
```


## Features
* `cty` - By default `std::os::raw` is used to get C fundamental types(e.g. `long`, `int` etc.) the `cty` feature replaces libstd with [cty crate](https://github.com/japaric/cty)


## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
Currently it officially supports only rust nightly, because most interaction with the kernel requires assembly anyway.
In practice both `beta` and `stable` are tested in the CI.
but I do plan to add an autodetect feature to [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen) such that it will work with whatever version [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen) can generate for.
